## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" .

First I have set the Working Directory. Then downloaded the dataset file household_power_consumption.txt in the Working Directory.

Then Created following R Codes:

1. Plot1.R
2. Plot2.R
3. Plot3.R
4. Plot4.R

When R Codes of these files are executed it creates PNG Graphs. Each R Code creates a PNG Graph: Corresponding R Code and Graphs are shown below:

R Code                  PNG Graph File

1. Plot1.R                Plot1.png
2. Plot2.R                Plot2.png
3. Plot3.R                Plot3.png
4. Plot4.R                Plot4.png
